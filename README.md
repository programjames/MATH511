# MATH 511 Homework

This is all my homework for **MATH 511:** *Numerical Methods for PDE's*. It was all written in Jupyter Notebook (Python) with the `numpy`, `scipy`, and `seaborn` modules. GitHub should be able to display the notebooks, but if it can't there are also HTML files. If you don't know where to start, I would recommend the following three files:

- [HW 16](HW&#32;16&#32;-&#32;James&#32;Camacho.ipynb)
- [HW 19](HW&#32;19&#32;-&#32;James&#32;Camacho.ipynb)
- [HW 32â€“34](HW&#32;32-34&#32;-&#32;James&#32;Camacho.ipynb)
